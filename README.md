# Scripts
Scripts for the Re-Volt community.

## Installers
Re-Volt installers for the RVA community, which install the game & the RVA bunlded in at the same time.

[`Ubuntu`](https://github.com/Re-Volt-America/Scripts/blob/master/install/ubuntu/re-volt-ubuntu-installer.sh): Run this script **without** sudo, and preferably at your home directory or Desktop. It will generate a Re-Volt folder where it's executed and a shortcut to launch the game at your Desktop dir.
